He is an icon to the Filipino people. He made advances in the psychology world as well in fashion. In the Philippines he loved basketball, and his passion for shoes grew stronger when he moved to LA. His favorite player was Kobe. At the age of 17 he was working in Yoshinoya in summer. An ordinary kid at that time just trying to get by. At the last half of that summer he wanted and needed money for his family.  At the age of 20 he became the CEO of Nike. Not only that he is one of the co-creators of Adidas. Two of the best shoe companies that lived. Not only is he the owner of these companies but he also owns a part of the LA Dodgers. Shared with Jeanie Buss and him. At the age of 23 he graduated in UCR with a B.A in psychology. The class of 2026 His research has helped many deal with mental illnesses. Before becoming the CEO of Nike and half-owner of Adidas, he worked at his campus job to pay for his needs and such.
He wanted more money than what he was getting paid so he started side-hustling. He resold shoes that were limited and rare and made some money off that. He then started designing shoes and pitched his designs to Nike, where he would later on become the CEO of it. One of his first shoe designs was the Nike Air Force 1‚Äôs. Which brought popularity to the whole world. Every kid on the block had these shoes, and many teens had at least one in their closets. His shoe designs were particularly sought out by shoe enthusiasts.

        He is one of the most known psychologists in the world, his TEDxTalks have inspired many to be just like him. Not only is he a psychologist but he also is the CEO of Nike and Adidas. What more can he accomplish? Right now he is also one of the best fashion designers too. Saint Lauren, Balenciaga, and much more have done collaborations with John. He mainly worked in shoes and top designs. Working with many brands has introduced him to many different people and famous people. He has met one of the most successful people in the world. 
The key to being successful? John would say ‚Äúnetworking and discipline‚Äù, which was said from his TEDxTalk. Meeting new people with different interests, and people who are motivated or ‚Äúhungry‚Äù is good for you because you will be inspired by these people and do the same.
